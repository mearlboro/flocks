class ReynoldsModel(FlockModel):
    """
    Setup the parameters for the Reynolds model simulation. The model simulates
    the behaviour of flocking birdoid objects (boids) in a 2D continuous space.
    In addition to the Vicsek model, the Reynolds model includes an aggegation
    and an avoidance parameter. The version used here is a simplified version of
    Reynold's [1] similar to the ones used by Seth [2] and Rosas et al [3], with
    boids behaving as particles with no mass, shape or dimension. Each boid is
    characterised by its coordinates, angle of flight (in radians) and scalar
    speed.

    The position xi, yi of each boid i evolves as follows:

        xi(t + dt) = xi(t) + vi * cos(Ai(t)) * dt
        yi(t + dt) = yi(t) + vi * sin(Ai(t)) * dt

    where vi is the speed of particle i and the new angle of velocity Ai(t) is:

        Ai(t + dt) = Ai(t) + R1(i) + R2(i) + R3(i)

    where the three rules, using the scalar model params a1, a2, a3, regulate the
    behaviour of each boid with respect to its neighbours' proximity, direction,
    and centre of mass.
    cf. https://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/gdc99/

    In the Reynolds model the neighbourhood is always metric and ignores certain
    angles at the back (a.k.a. simulated perception). In this simplified version
    we omit it and use the metric neighbourhood convention from the Vicsek model,
    where metric neighbours are chosen with parameter r that controls the range
    of the neighbourhood. The model can also be used with topological neigbours.
